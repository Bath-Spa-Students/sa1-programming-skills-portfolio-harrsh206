## Exercise 3: Biography - 25 Marks

#In this exercise, you'll create a program that stores and prints your name, hometown, and age to the console using a Python dictionary.

### Steps:
#1. Store the information (name, hometown, and age) as key-value pairs in a dictionary.
#2. Print the values on separate lines using a single `print()` statement.
#3. Use variables with appropriate data types for each piece of information.

Data ={"name": "Harhin Kriss","hometown": "Sharjah","age": 19} #Input of our biography that will be displayed
print(Data["name"]) #To display the name 
print(Data["hometown"]) #To display the hometown
print(Data["age"]) #To display the age
