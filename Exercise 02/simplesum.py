## Exercise 2: Simple Sums - 15 Marks

#In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arithmetic operations, and print the result to the console.

### Steps:
#1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value `8`.
#2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value `10`.
#3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
#4. Print the value of the sum to the console

#simple sums
#inserting an integer to the first variable 
alpha = (int(8))

#inserting an integer to the second variable
bravo = (int(10))

#inserting both the first and second variable to the third variable
charle = (alpha + bravo)

#print the variable charle
print(charle)
